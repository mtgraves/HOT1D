Brief Description
=====

This 1-D HOT theory code is for a 1-D forest.
It allows you to choose (from command line):
forest size, a tunable parameter for the
distribution of sparks, and the number of times
to try a tree for each spark in order to choose
where to put the next tree.  If you look in the
HOT(underscore)1D.py file, you may also change
the number of sparks.

Dependencies

- Python 2.4 or 2.7
- Numpy
- Matplotlib
- Pylab
- Cython (with pyximport capabilities)
